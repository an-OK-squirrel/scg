# How the things do the things

## so like, how tokens are seperated
## and parsers in general

###### if you are using a command line for text editing, you probably hate me right now lel

So tokens are seperated in these ways:

## Strings

Strings are things, and they do the things

they are seperatored by the mystical ' symbol

## Variables

Vars can be either 1 character *lowercase* or multi-character *UPPERCASE*

`ABC` => `ABC`
`AbCCDEfghI` => `A b CCDE f g h I`

# Token object

Token objs have two properties: `type` and `value`. self explanatory.
